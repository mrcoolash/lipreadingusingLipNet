# ðŸ“˜ Lipreading using LipNet

## 1. Overview

This project implements **LipNet**, a deep learning model for end-to-end lipreading. It takes **video frames of a speakerâ€™s mouth** as input and outputs the corresponding **spoken sentence** as text.

Pipeline includes:

* **Data preprocessing** (video frame extraction, resizing, normalization).
* **Label encoding** (mapping spoken sentences to character sequences).
* **LipNet architecture** (3D Convolutions â†’ Spatiotemporal feature extraction â†’ Bidirectional GRUs â†’ CTC Loss for sequence alignment).
* **Training loop** with accuracy tracking.
* **Inference** for decoding predictions into text.

## 2. Data Pipeline

### 2.1 Input

* **Raw video clips**: typically RGB videos of a person speaking.
* Each clip â†’ sequence of frames (`T x H x W x C`).
* Ground-truth transcription: spoken sentence (characters).

### 2.2 Preprocessing

* Frames extracted and resized (usually `50x100` per frame).
* Normalization applied (`[0,1]` scale).
* Sentences tokenized to character indices.

**Output**:

* `(Batch, Time, Height, Width, Channels)` tensor for videos.
* `(Batch, SequenceLength)` tensor for labels.

## 3. Model Architecture (LipNet)

### 3.1 Input Shape

```
Video Input: (Batch, Time=75, Height=50, Width=100, Channels=3)
```

### 3.2 Layers

1. **3D Convolution Blocks**

   * Three stacked Conv3D layers with BatchNorm + Dropout + MaxPooling.
   * Capture **spatiotemporal features** across consecutive frames.

2. **Flatten + TimeDistributed**

   * Frames compressed into feature vectors per timestep.

3. **Bidirectional GRUs (2 layers)**

   * Extract **temporal dependencies** across frames.
   * Forward + backward GRUs capture context from entire sequence.

4. **Fully Connected (Dense)**

   * TimeDistributed dense layer over GRU outputs.
   * Softmax over character vocabulary.

5. **CTC Loss Layer**

   * Used instead of cross-entropy to align variable-length sequences without explicit frame-to-label mapping.

### 3.3 Output

* Predicted character probabilities per timestep.
* After decoding â†’ final predicted sentence.

## 4. Training Pipeline

* **Loss Function**: CTC Loss (`keras.backend.ctc_batch_cost`).
* **Optimizer**: Adam.
* **Metrics**: Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER), Accuracy.
* **Batch Input**:

  * `inputs`: video tensor.
  * `labels`: ground truth sequences.
  * `input_length`, `label_length`: required for CTC alignment.

**Output**:

* Trained LipNet model weights.
* Logs of training loss and validation accuracy.

## 5. Inference (Prediction)

### Input

* Single video clip of lip movements.

### Process

1. Preprocess frames (resize, normalize).
2. Pass through trained LipNet.
3. Decode using **best path decoding** or **beam search decoding**.

### Output

* Predicted text transcription of spoken words.
